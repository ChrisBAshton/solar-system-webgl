# CS32310 - Advanced Computer Graphics assignment

The assignment, worth 50% of the module, requires rendering a 3D animated solar system in WebGL.

# Instructions

Run:

```bash

cd ~/Dropbox/uni/year_4/cs323_10_advanced_computer_graphics/assignment

python -m SimpleHTTPServer
```

Then go to [http://localhost:8000/](http://localhost:8000/) to see the solar system.

# Explanation

The orbiting algorithm follows a 7-step process, outlined in the figure below.
